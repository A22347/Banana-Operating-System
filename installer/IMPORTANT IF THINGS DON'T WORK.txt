If you the bootloader seems to stop working, or the install suddenly takes much longer,
try cleaning out the /Root directory. I think the installer code only searches the first sector of the
file table for the kernel image, and gets very confused if it isn't there.

ALSO: update the start sector of OSIMAGE.SYS - THE INSTALLER DOES NOT SEARCH THE FILESYSTEM FOR IT!!!
