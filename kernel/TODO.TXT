The reported size of a symlink is the number of characters in the path it points to. 
The functions readlink and lstat also refrain from following symbolic links, because
 their purpose is to obtain information about the link. link, the function that makes
 a hard link, does too. It makes a hard link to the symbolic link, which one rarely wants. 

The macro MAXSYMLINKS specifies how many symlinks some function will follow before returning ELOOP
