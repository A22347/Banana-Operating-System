# Banana
Banana is a 32-bit hobby operating system written in C and C++ which can be ran on real hardware. The kernel is pre-emptive and supports loading ELF drivers and modules from the disk.
It comes with an installer which can be run from floppies or a CD-ROM. Currently only has a command line shell, but is planned to also have a Win9x style GUI.
